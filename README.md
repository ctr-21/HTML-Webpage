<h1>HTML Webpage</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a simple webpage regarding three different exotic animals, based on a research assignment that I did in my <i>Programming for Cybersecurity</i> class.
With the use of various programming languages, I was able to practice and play around with each language in a fun way. This project has given me the opportunity to strengthen my programming skills.
