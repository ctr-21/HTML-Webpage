      Do you know about <b>exotic animals?</b> No, not your pet cat, dog, or
      your basic goldfish. I'm talking about real exotic animals that you don't
      see every day, or ever for that matter. Well, they are out there and some
      of which are too dangerous to encounter. Even for humans, some of these
      exotic creatures can cause severe, or fatal, injuries if provoked in the
      wild. If you haven't guessed already, here are some of
      <b
        >the most terrifying exotic animals to ever walk, or swim, on planet
        Earth.</b

    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px">
      Found throughout Africa is the most aggresive type of crocodile on planet
      Earth; the <b>Nile Crocodile.</b> First of all, this beast is afraid of
      nothing and is the second-largest crocodile in the world, with the largest
      ever recorded at a whopping <b>21 feet, 2 inches</b> long, and weighed
      around <b>2,400 pounds!</b> Secondly, these exotic creatures have between
      <b>64 and 68 teeth</b> and pack a powerful bite. You do not want to come
      in contact with these creatures because the result can be fatal. Nile
      Crocodiles usually drown their prey underwater first, until they precede
      to start tearing flesh off. Lastly, the Nile Crocodile is an Apex
      Predator, meaning that they eat all sorts of
      <b>fish, birds, mammals, and other reptiles.</b> Humans can, and will be
      apart of their meal prep too, if you are not careful. You should be okay
      to look at them from a distance, only because they often prey on animals
      that drink water at the edge of rivers, marshs, swamps, or lakes. Animals,
      or any acceptable food source for that matter, that drink from the edge
      usually end up getting snatched by Nile Crocodiles, starting the meal prep
      stage mentioned earlier. The chances of surviving the powerful bite(s) of
      the Nile Crocodiles, escaping the drowning phase, and getting away without
      any serious or life-threatening injuries is very, very low. So, it's best
      to keep a distance from these exotic creatures, the farther the better,
      because your life could end up depending on it.

    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px">
      This exotic ocean dweller is native to the <b>Pacific Ocean</b> and is a
      lot more terrifying than it looks. With venom that is
      <b>1000 times</b> more powerful than any other octopus, the
      <b>Blue-Ringed Octopus</b> is considered one of the most deadliest animals
      in the ocean. This exotic creature has enough venom to kill
      <b>more than 25 humans within minutes.</b> What's even crazier is that
      there is no known cure for this little guy's venom, making it very
      dangerous if you are bitten by them. When they feel threatened, the
      Blue-Ringed Octopus activates the blue rings all around its body as a
      <b>warning signal</b> to visitors or other ocean dwellers. When you are
      unfortunate enough to be bitten by one, you won't feel anything at first,
      but after a couple of minutes you will start feeling the side effects of
      the venom. First, the venom will
      <b>block your nerve signals all throughout the body </b> causing your
      muscles to numb. Your body will likely go into muscle paralysis. Then, you
      will experience
      <b>nausea, vision loss, and loss of basic motor skills</b> because of the
      numbness of your muscles. Finally, you will likely go into
      <b>respiratory arrest</b> due to your important breathing muscles going
      numb. If you immediately know that you have been bitten by the Blue-Ringed
      Octopus, it is best you call <b>911</b> as soon as possible so that they
      can arrive to assist you before the side effects kick in. However, there
      hasn't been any recorded deaths from this creature since the 1960's, so if
      you ever see this exotic creature, its best to look from a distance and
      never get too close, especially if you start to see the blue rings.

      <div class="Wolverine">The Wolverine</div>

    />

    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px">
      This exotic animal inhabits mainly timbered areas in the colder parts of
      <b>North America</b> and <b>Eurasia.</b> This animal my be small, but it
      is very terrifying considering the different animals and mammals it preys
      on. This is the <b>Wolverine</b>, and as mentioned above, the Wolverine
      feasts on all sorts of animals including those more than twice it's own
      size. Here are some of the animals Wolverines feast on:
    </p>

    <div class="centered-list-Container">
      <ul class="centered-list">
        <li>Deer</li>
        <li>Elk</li>
        <li>Sheep</li>
        <li>Moose</li>
        <li>Wolves</li>
        <li>Small Bears</li>
        <li>Other Livestock</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px">
      The Wolverine also has <b>long, sharp claws</b> and is very strong and
      ferocious. Because of this, the Wolverine is fearless and able to fight,
      or fight off, almost any predator. The powerful claws are able to tear
      flesh right off the victims body, while then using it's strong teeth for
      further dissembly. Although the Wolverine is terrifying when provoked,that
      is generally all that will occur if you come in contact with one; you will
      only provoke it. Wolverines, fortunately for you, are generally not known
      to actively hunt or attack humans. But, they will if you somehow threaten
      or corner it. With this exotic animal, it is also best to keep a distance
      from it because if provoked, the Wolverine can do some serious damage.
